# Getting started [10 mins]

1. Split up into pairs. You will take turns being a "driver" and a "navigator".
   Decide who will be participant A and who will be participant B.
2. We will use VS Code for this exercise. Ensure both of you have the "Live
   Share" extension installed. This exercise is as much about practicing pairing
   as it is about getting familiar with VS Code Live Share.
3. Participant A: clone this repo to you machine and start a live share session
   by selecting the Live Share icon in your side menu bar and clicking the
   "Share" button. You may be asked to sign-in.
4. Once the session is initiated, send the URL (which should have automatically
   copied to your clipboard) to your partner.
5. Participant B: Copy the link, select the Live Share icon in your side menu
   bar in VS Code and click the "Join" button. You may be asked to sign-in.
   Paste the link into the pop-up and hit Enter.
6. Participant A: Keep an eye on the lower right of your screen for a pop-up;
   you need to accept the connection with read-write permissions. Once this is
   done, you should now see your partner's name under "Participants" in the Live
   Share Session Details. If your partner is in read-only mode, right click
   their name and enable read-write access.
7. Congratulations! You are both now in a live share session and ready to start
   pair programming in an interactive fashion.
8. If at any point you lose your partner's cursor, click on their name under
   Participants to start following them again.

Once you are done with the exercise, you can proceed to [Task 1](1.1-task-1.md).
